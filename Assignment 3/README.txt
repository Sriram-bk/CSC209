In order to detect hard links and link them, instead of creating duplicate files, we would need to keep track of the inode numbers of files that have already been copied. This is done in order to create links to the file the next time theyâ€™re encountered. Since our design uses different processes to copy different directories, each process would need to have an up to date list of the inode numbers of files that have been copied. This would require every process to communicate with every other process through pipes. This would make it hard to detect hard links.
